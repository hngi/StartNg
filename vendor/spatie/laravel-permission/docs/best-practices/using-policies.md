The best way to incorporate access control for access to app features is with Model Policies. This way your application logic can be combined with your permission rules, keeping your implementation simpler. You can find an example of implementing a model policy with this Laravel Permissions package in this demo app: https://github.com/drbyte/spatie-permissions-demo/blob/master/app/Policies/PostPolicy.php
